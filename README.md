# Python training and archive
This Repository is meant to be a training playground to improve my python skills and 
to establish better habbits while programming. There is no specific topic or 
dircetion for this repository. It will be filled mostly with snippets from tutorials or 
will act as a kind of personal snippet archive. 

# Habbits
The following rules are set by my self, for my self in order to establish better 
habbits while writing code:

1. English! Everything!
2. Names for variables, functions and files should not be assinged without a tought.
3. Documentation. Write comments and use pdoc (https://pdoc.dev/) or Sphinx (https://www.sphinx-doc.org)
4. Testing. Write test for functions!
5. Logging. No printf-debugging! Use logs!

_This list might be updated at a given time..._

# Disclaimer

here for me to learn. If you find something useful (which I dont think will be the case,
because I don not develop new things here), be very careful while using it.
